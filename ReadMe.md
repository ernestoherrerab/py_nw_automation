This is the frontend for the applications to run different network automation tasks.

Here you will find different network applications:

1. Network Infrastructure Links - Is just a collection of links used by the team.
2. ISE MAC Bypass: adds MAC addresses to a bypass list for guest users in ISE.
3. Topology Builder: by entering either a YML host file or a specific Core Switch info, topology diagrams are generated automatically which can then be downloaded.

An environment file called ".env" should also exist in the same directory where the script exists.
