# Node JS Installation

Node JS and React are used to create the application that displays the site documentation in a "Windows Explorer" kind of way.
Flask is not as sophisticated to handle this type of directory navigation, therefore the approach was this.

Java Script is used to develop the code that handles the display of the directory.

To install Node JS in Ubuntu 20.04, which is used by the Devbox follow these instructions:

1. Activate the virtual environment. 

2. sudo apt update

3. sudo apt install nodejs

4. Test node js was installed by running node -v on the CLI, you should be able to see the version.
